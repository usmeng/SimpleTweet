# Project 4 - *SimpleTwitter*

**SimpleTwitter** is an android app that allows a user to view home and mentions timelines, view user profiles with user timelines, as well as compose and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index).

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

 * [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
 * [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
 * [x] On the profile screen, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to [apply scrolling behavior](https://hackmd.io/s/SJyDOCgU) as the user scrolls through the profile timeline.
